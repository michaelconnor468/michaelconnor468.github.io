        <p>Nanopay is a digital payments company providing back-end transaction processing for banks and it's own proprietary acconting software. The focus of the dev team is to make transactions as fast and secure as possible, and to provide a cost effective solution to transaction processing.</p>
        <p>During the fall here, I worked to designed new features for and expanded the functionality of a dynamic generator of database access logic which allowed easy creation and modification of code that processed data within the database system. All database access logic was upgraded to be generated by this system. Additionally, I helped codesign and implement a new authorization security framework based on transitive access relationships allowing for flexible and intuitive ways for our clients to set up complex levels of access control within their systems.</p>
        <p>In the Summer, I modified the framework script parser to allow for parsing of a cleaner, more robust syntax of scripts allowing for more efficient use of developer and productivity by obviating the need for extensive debugging of script syntax. I also created a dynamic database monitoring framework to automatically detect performance issues with framework database access objects and greatly decrease use of server resources. Furthermore, I worked to fix and update the automated swift code generation within the framework.</p>
