	Welcome to my webpage! I am a Software Engineer from Toronto with experience as a full-stack developer. My philosophy is that all software should be lightweight and extensible, while maintaining the same great qualities that make it stand out. The hard reality for any business is, software is incredibly expensive to develop; costing thousands to make, debug, and extend. Good software is robust and reliable, easily modified and understood by others, and most importantly, not a hasty patch that will cause much expense and anguish down the road. Though something no one can trully master, such software is what I continuously strive towards as a developer with a passion for their craft.
