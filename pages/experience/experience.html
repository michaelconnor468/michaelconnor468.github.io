        <p>During the fall here, I worked to designed new features for and expanded the functionality of a dynamic generator of database access logic which allowed easy creation and modification of code that processed data within the database system. All database access logic was upgraded to be generated by this system. Additionally, I helped design and implement a new authorization security framework based on transitive access relationships allowing for flexible and intuitive ways for our clients to set up complex levels of access control within their systems.</p>
